    "1. **Create three variables as an object variable**:\n",
    "   - A variable called `studentName` that stores your name as a string.\n",
    "   - A variable called `age` that stores your age as a number.\n",
    "   - A variable called `isStudent` that stores a boolean value indicating whether you are a student (use `true` or `false`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. **Create a function variable that displays that your favorite song is playing**:\n",
    "   \n",
    "      - A variable called `favoriteSong` that stores the name of your favorite song.\n",
    "      - A variable called `songArtist` that stores the song's artist.\n",
    "      - A function called `playFavoriteSong` that logs a message saying \"Now playing [favoriteSong] by [songArtist]\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using the variables you created**, write a sentence using `console.log()` to display:\n",
    "   - Your name.\n",
    "   - Your age.\n",
    "   - Whether you are a student.\n",
    "   - An output that states that your favorite song is now playing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example output:\n",
    "My name is [Your Name], I am [Your Age] years old, and it is [true/false] that I am a student. \n",
    "Now playing Champion by Kanye West"
